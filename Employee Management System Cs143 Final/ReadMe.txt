For this program we created and easy to run Jar file that executes our program. 
The first step to using this program is selecting:

option 1:) Add Employee. Once selected a new slide is shown where it is clearly labeled where you 
enter all the employee’s information. Once all the data is entered, you hit the submit button to save the employee to the system. 
You can add as many employees to the system as you would like you just need to hit option 1:) and enter in another employee.
Once one, or more, employees have been entered into the system; there is a variety of things you can do with the employee’s information to view or edit it.

Option 2:) Edit/Modify Employee allows the user to select an already added employee in the system using their first and last name. 

Make sure to type the name exactly as it was entered, or you will not be able to locate the employee in the system to edit them. 
Once the employee is found, you can edit any one of the previous data areas with new information and submit it. 

Option 3:) Remove employee simply allows you to select an employee in the system via their first and last name and completely remove them from the system. 

Option 4:) View all Employees in the system allows you to view the data of all employees that were entered in the system and using the 
previous and next buttons to navigate through them. Option 5:)View individual Employee allows the user to Search up a single employee via first and 
last name so that they will be able to view their information. 

Option 6:) Display organization specific employees allows the user to look up all employees in a specific corporation by
 entering in the name of the corporation and submitting. 

Option 7:) allows the user to quickly quit the entire program once the button is pushed.

Every one of the slides in our program, except for the main menu, has a button leading directly back to the main menu. 
We also made it so if a user does not submit the information, when they go back to add employee, the unsubmitted employee 
information will still be there unless deleted. For all the text boxes that require text entry we put a clear button beneath the submit 
button to quickly be able to clear all text fields.
Something to remember when using this program is that the submit button must be pushed when entering in new data or the data will not be saved.
